## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Concepts

This project showcases several professional software development concepts, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The system is built around classes like `User`, `Transactions`, `UserService`, and `UserRepo`, demonstrating principles of **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and modular design.
- **Layered Architecture:** The application is structured into distinct layers, promoting a separation of concerns:
    - **`main`:** Handles the user interface and application flow.
    - **`services`:** Contains the business logic, acting as an intermediary between the UI and the data layer.
    - **`repository`:** Manages data persistence, simulating a database using in-memory collections like `HashSet` and `HashMap`.
- **Data Structures:** The system efficiently uses standard Java collections (`Set`, `List`, `Map`) to store and manage data. A `HashSet` is used for storing users to ensure their uniqueness.
- **Java Stream API:** Modern Java Stream API is used for efficient data processing, such as filtering users and transactions, leading to more concise and readable code.
- **Robust Error Handling:** The application includes basic checks for common issues like incorrect credentials or insufficient funds, providing a smoother user experience.
- **Modularity:** The code is organized into separate packages (`main`, `services`, `repository`, `entity`), promoting a highly organized and reusable structure.
